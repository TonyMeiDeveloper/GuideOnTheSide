TUTORIAL:

Step 1: Find and Launch a Server

I started from scratch. I have no server so I will sign up for AWS or Amazon Web Services which provides cloud servers.  
Go to https://aws.amazon.com. To sign up, you will need an email address and credit card information. Don't worry. You only get charged if free trial is all used or if you add more services. Be sure to check out pricing at https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/services/.
