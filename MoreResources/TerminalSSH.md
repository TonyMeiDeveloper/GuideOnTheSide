If you using a Mac or Linux, search for Terminal. It should be preinstalled. I HOPE :)

You should know some Terminal Commands that are commonly use.  
First is ls which lists and shows all the files and folders on your current directory.

```
ls
```

Next is cd. It changes your directory. Before, we downloaded the key. The key is in my downloads folder so cd Downloads to get to the Downloads directory. If the key downloaded is in your desktop. Do cd Desktop. ETC. 

```
cd Downloads
```
