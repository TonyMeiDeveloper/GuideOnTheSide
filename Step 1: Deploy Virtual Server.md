##Step 1: Launching a Server, or in this case, a virtual server


I started from scratch. I have no server so I will sign up for AWS or Amazon Web Services which provides cloud servers.  
Go to https://aws.amazon.com. To sign up, you will need an email address and credit card information. Don't worry. You only get charged if free trial is all used or if you add more services. Be sure to check out pricing at https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/services/.

After you sign up, go to the top and Click My Account -> AWS Management Console. You will be greeted with a dashboard of Amazon Web Services.

Once you click on EC2, you will be greeted with a dashboard. At first glance, it will seem overwhelming, but we will go over only the configurations you need to deploy Guide on the Side or any web applications once you have the server set up.

Right in the middle of the dashboard, you will see a big blue button to launch instance. Click on it. From my understanding, an Instance is a virtual server.
